# wsl2-lando-docker-ce-equiv
An equivs-generated package for Ubuntu to simulate Docker CE being installed so that Lando in Linux can use Docker for Windows.

This is a dummy package so that you can easily install and update Lando from within Ubuntu Linux on WSL2 without having to hack your installed packages list.
